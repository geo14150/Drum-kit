🥁 JavaScript Drum Kit
This is a fun, interactive web application that functions as a virtual drum kit. Players can use either their mouse to click the on-screen buttons or their keyboard keys to trigger seven different drum sounds.

✨ Features
Interactive Buttons: Seven separate drum buttons labeled with the keys: w, a, s, d, j, k, l.

Mouse and Keyboard Input: Supports sound playback both when a button is clicked with the mouse and when the corresponding key is pressed on the keyboard.

Sound Feedback: Each button/key press plays a unique .wav audio file (sound1.wav through sound7.wav).

Visual Feedback: An animation effect (.pressed CSS class) briefly highlights the active button upon interaction, mimicking a drum strike.

Vanilla Implementation: Built using only fundamental web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) with no external libraries.
